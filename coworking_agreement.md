## Accessibility Needs
Prioritze working in office. in office hours 10-5. 

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Working together most of the time. 

If both parties have a comfortable understanding of topic work independently to get tedious coding done effeciantly. Individual work done on own time. 

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

Ivy: Hand on learning style, lots of running half done code. goal: try to communicate through thought process

Alma: Read the instructions first, search a little bit any doubts and then start coding. 
Goal: work more in doing, and faster in reading.

## Preferred Feedback/Teaching Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Ivy: Prefer blunt feedback. dont worry about my feelings. Tell me to shut up if im talking too much

Alma. Prefer direct and on the moment the feedback. I'm open to talk about doing it better.

"The way I thought of", "another solution", 

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

Ivy: Take a step back, and communicate what/why im doing stuff

Alma: Talk more and express myself a little more.
